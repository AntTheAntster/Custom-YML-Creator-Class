# Custom-YML-Creator-Class
Create custom YML data files for whatever you need!

First you must reference the "setup" function in your main class under onEnable(). Example:

public void onEnable(){
  
  PlayerDataFile.setup(); //PlayerDataFile will be changed to the name of your class.
  
}

From there, you can use <ClassName>.save(), .get(), and .reload().
